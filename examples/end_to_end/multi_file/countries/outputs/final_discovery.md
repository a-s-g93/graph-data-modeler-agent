### Summary of Insights for Graph Data Model

#### Unique Identifiers
1. **State ID (`id`)**: Unique identifier for each state.
2. **Country ID**: Unique identifier for each country.
3. **Subregion ID**: Unique identifier for each subregion (not explicitly mentioned but can be derived from the unique subregions).
4. **City ID**: Unique identifier for each city (not explicitly mentioned but can be derived from the city dataset).

#### Significant Properties
1. **State Name (`name`)**: Name of the state.
2. **Country Name**: Name of the country associated with each state.
3. **Subregion Name**: Name of the subregion associated with each country.
4. **Currency**: Currency used by each country (requires additional data).
5. **Capital**: Capital city of each country (requires additional data).
6. **City Name**: Name of the city (requires additional data).

#### Possible Node Labels
1. **State**: Represents each state in the dataset.
2. **Country**: Represents each country in the dataset.
3. **Subregion**: Represents each subregion in the dataset.
4. **City**: Represents each city in the dataset (requires additional data).

#### Possible Relationships
1. **BELONGS_TO**: Between `State` and `Country` (a state belongs to a country).
2. **PART_OF**: Between `Country` and `Subregion` (a country is part of a subregion).
3. **HAS_CURRENCY**: Between `Country` and `Currency` (a country has a currency).
4. **HAS_CAPITAL**: Between `Country` and `City` (a country has a capital city).
5. **LOCATED_IN**: Between `City` and `Subregion` (a city is located in a subregion).

#### Insights Addressing Use Cases
- **Subregions and Countries**: The dataset contains **22 unique subregions**. Each subregion can be linked to multiple countries, allowing for analysis of how many countries exist within each subregion.
- **Common Currency**: The most common currency is **EUR (Euro)**, used by **35 countries**. This can be represented in the graph model as a relationship between countries and their respective currencies.
- **Cities in Subregions**: The dataset indicates that there are **150,454 cities**. By linking cities to their respective subregions, it will be possible to analyze which subregions contain the most cities.

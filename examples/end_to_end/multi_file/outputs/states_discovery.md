### Preliminary Analysis of `states.csv`

#### Overview of the Data
- The dataset contains **5077 entries** with **3 columns**: `id`, `name`, and `country_id`.
- The `id` column serves as a unique identifier for each state, while the `name` column represents the name of the state. The `country_id` column links each state to its respective country.

#### Key Features
1. **State ID (`id`)**:
   - Unique identifier for each state.
   - Ranges from **1 to 5220** with a mean of approximately **2609.77**.
   - The distribution shows a relatively wide spread, indicating a diverse set of states.

2. **State Name (`name`)**:
   - Contains **4965 unique names** out of **5077 entries**, indicating that some states share the same name (e.g., "Western Province" appears **5 times**).
   - This feature is crucial for identifying states and may help in understanding regional naming conventions.

3. **Country ID (`country_id`)**:
   - This column is used to associate states with their respective countries. Although it is marked to be ignored for the analysis, it is essential for linking states to countries in the broader dataset.
   - The `country_id` ranges from **1 to 248**, suggesting that there are multiple countries represented in the dataset.

#### Insights Related to Use Cases
- **Subregions and Countries**: The `country_id` can be used to group states by their respective countries, which can then be further analyzed to determine how many subregions exist within each region and how many countries are represented in each subregion.
- **Common Currency**: The current dataset does not contain currency information. To analyze the most common currency, additional data regarding currencies associated with each country would be required.
- **Cities in Subregions**: The dataset does not include city-level data. To determine which subregions contain the most cities, a separate dataset containing city information linked to states or subregions would be necessary.

#### Conclusion
- The most important features in this dataset are the `id` and `name` columns, as they provide unique identification and naming for states. The `country_id` is also significant for linking states to their respective countries, which is essential for further analysis related to regions and subregions.
- To fully address the use cases, additional datasets containing information on subregions, currencies, and cities would be required.

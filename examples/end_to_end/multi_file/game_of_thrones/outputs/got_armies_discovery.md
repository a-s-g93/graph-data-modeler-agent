### Preliminary Analysis of the `got_armies.csv` Data

#### Overview
The dataset contains information about battles in the Game of Thrones universe, with a total of 184 entries and 7 features. The key features include battle identifiers, army sizes, and details about the families and commanders involved in the battles.

#### Key Features and Their Importance
1. **battle_number**:
   - **Importance**: This feature serves as a unique identifier for each battle, allowing us to track battles over time. It can help analyze trends in battle occurrences and changes in alliances.
   - **Analysis**: The battles are numbered from 1 to 38, with a mean of approximately 20. This suggests that battles are not uniformly distributed over time, which may indicate periods of intense conflict.

2. **king**:
   - **Importance**: The king associated with each battle can provide insights into political dynamics and alliances. Changes in the king may correlate with shifts in family alliances.
   - **Analysis**: There are 6 unique kings, with Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon being the most frequent. This suggests a concentration of power and potential for alliance shifts among the families supporting these kings.

3. **outcome**:
   - **Importance**: Understanding the outcome of battles (won/lost) is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness of different families and commanders. It can also indicate which families are more aggressive or successful in their military endeavors.
   - **Analysis**: The majority of battles (101 out of 178) were won, indicating a possible trend of successful strategies or dominant families.

4. **family**:
   - **Importance**: This feature identifies the significant families involved in the battles. It is essential for analyzing alliances, rivalries, and the frequency of attacks by different families.
   - **Analysis**: There are 21 unique families, with the Lannisters being the most involved (40 occurrences). This suggests that the Lannisters may have been a central player in the conflicts.

5. **size**:
   - **Importance**: The size of the army can indicate the scale of battles and the resources available to different families. Analyzing army sizes over time can reveal trends in military strength and strategy.
   - **Analysis**: The average army size is approximately 16,831, with a wide range (20 to 100,000). This variability suggests that some battles were fought with significantly larger forces, which may correlate with outcomes.

6. **commander**:
   - **Importance**: The commander leading an army can influence battle outcomes and strategies. Analyzing commanders can help identify effective leaders and their associated families.
   - **Analysis**: There are 81 unique commanders, with Stannis Baratheon being the most frequent. This indicates a diverse set of leadership styles and strategies across battles.

7. **attacking**:
   - **Importance**: This boolean feature indicates whether a family was attacking or defending. It is crucial for understanding the dynamics of aggression and defense in battles.
   - **Analysis**: All entries are present, allowing for a clear understanding of which families were on the offensive.

#### Use Case Insights
- **Families Changing Alliances**: By analyzing the `king` and `family` features, we can identify shifts in alliances based on which families supported which kings over time.
- **Army Size Changes Over Time**: The `size` feature can be analyzed in conjunction with `battle_number` to observe trends in army sizes across different battles.
- **Families Attacking Most Often**: The `family` and `attacking` features can be used to determine which families were most frequently on the offensive, indicating their aggressiveness in the conflicts.

### Conclusion
The most important features for the analysis of alliances, army sizes, and attack frequency are `family`, `king`, `size`, and `outcome`. These features will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the battles and the relationships between the families involved.

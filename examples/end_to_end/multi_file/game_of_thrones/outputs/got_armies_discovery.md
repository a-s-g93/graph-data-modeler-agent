LLM Generated Discovery
### Preliminary Analysis of the `got_armies.csv` Data

#### Overview
The dataset contains information about battles in the Game of Thrones universe, with a total of 184 entries and 7 features. The key features include battle number, king, outcome, family, size, commander, and whether the army was attacking.

#### Key Features and Insights
1. **Battle Number**:
   - Unique identifier for each battle, ranging from 1 to 38.
   - The distribution shows that battles are relatively evenly spread, with a mean of approximately 20.47.
   - This feature can help track the sequence of battles and analyze trends over time.

2. **Army Size**:
   - The size of the army varies significantly, with a mean of approximately 16,831 and a maximum of 100,000.
   - The presence of many null values (36 entries) suggests that not all battles have recorded army sizes, which may affect analysis.
   - This feature is crucial for understanding how army sizes have changed over time and can be correlated with outcomes.

3. **King**:
   - There are 6 unique kings, with Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon being the most frequently mentioned (65 occurrences).
   - This feature can help identify which kings are associated with specific families and their outcomes in battles.

4. **Outcome**:
   - The outcome is a binary feature indicating whether the battle was won or lost, with a slight majority of battles resulting in a win (101 wins out of 178 recorded outcomes).
   - This feature is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of different families and commanders in battles.

5. **Family**:
   - There are 21 unique families, with the Lannisters being the most frequently mentioned (40 occurrences).
   - This feature is critical for analyzing alliances and rivalries among families, as well as understanding which families attack most often.

6. **Commander**:
   - There are 81 unique commanders, with Stannis Baratheon being the most frequently mentioned (12 occurrences).
   - This feature can help analyze the impact of different commanders on battle outcomes and army sizes.

7. **Attacking**:
   - This boolean feature indicates whether the army was attacking, which can be used to analyze aggressive strategies of families.

#### Use Case Insights
- **Families Changing Alliances**: The family feature can be analyzed to see if certain families frequently switch between attacking and defending roles, or if they have common opponents over time.
- **Army Size Changes Over Time**: By correlating the battle number with army size, we can analyze trends in army sizes across different battles and families.
- **Most Frequent Attackers**: The family feature combined with the attacking boolean can help identify which families are more aggressive in their strategies.

#### Conclusion
The most important features for the analysis are `family`, `size`, `outcome`, and `battle_number`. These features will provide insights into family alliances, changes in army sizes, and the frequency of attacks by different families.

### Preliminary Analysis of the `got_armies.csv` Data

#### Overview
The dataset contains 184 entries with 7 features related to battles in the Game of Thrones universe. The key features include battle identifiers, army sizes, and affiliations of the armies involved in the battles.

#### Key Features and Their Importance
1. **battle_number**:
   - **Importance**: This feature serves as a unique identifier for each battle and can be used to analyze trends over time, such as changes in army sizes and alliances.
   - **Analysis**: The battles are numbered from 1 to 38, indicating that there are multiple battles per number, which may suggest that some battles are part of larger conflicts.

2. **king**:
   - **Importance**: This feature identifies the king associated with each army, which is crucial for understanding alliances and conflicts between families.
   - **Analysis**: There are 6 unique kings, with Joffrey/Tommen Baratheon being the most frequently mentioned. This could indicate a central figure in many battles, potentially affecting family alliances.

3. **outcome**:
   - **Importance**: This feature indicates whether the battle was won or lost, which is essential for assessing the effectiveness of different families and commanders.
   - **Analysis**: The outcome is mostly positive (won) for the armies, which could suggest a bias in the dataset towards successful battles or a lack of data on lost battles.

4. **family**:
   - **Importance**: This feature identifies the family associated with each army, which is critical for analyzing alliances and rivalries.
   - **Analysis**: There are 21 unique families, with the Lannisters being the most frequently represented. This could indicate their prominence in the battles and potential shifts in alliances.

5. **size**:
   - **Importance**: The size of the army is a key factor in battle outcomes and can be used to analyze trends over time.
   - **Analysis**: The army sizes vary significantly, with a mean of approximately 16,831 and a maximum of 100,000. The distribution suggests that while most armies are relatively small, there are a few very large armies that could skew the analysis.

6. **commander**:
   - **Importance**: This feature identifies the commanders leading the armies, which can help in understanding the effectiveness of different leaders and their strategies.
   - **Analysis**: There are 81 unique commanders, with Stannis Baratheon being the most frequently mentioned. This could indicate his role in multiple battles and his influence on the outcomes.

7. **attacking**:
   - **Importance**: This boolean feature indicates whether the army was attacking or defending, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of each battle.
   - **Analysis**: All entries are marked as attacking, which may limit the analysis of defensive strategies and outcomes.

#### Use Case Insights
- **Families Changing Alliances**: By analyzing the `king` and `family` features, we can track which families are allied with which kings over time, potentially revealing shifts in alliances.
- **Changes in Army Sizes Over Time**: The `size` and `battle_number` features can be used to plot army sizes across different battles, allowing us to visualize trends and changes.
- **Families Attacking Most Often**: The `family` and `attacking` features can be analyzed to determine which families are most frequently involved in attacks, providing insights into their aggressiveness and strategies.

### Conclusion
The most important features for the analysis are `family`, `king`, `size`, and `outcome`, as they provide critical insights into alliances, battle dynamics, and trends over time. Further analysis can be conducted to answer the specific use cases outlined.

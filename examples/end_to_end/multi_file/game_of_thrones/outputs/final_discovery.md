### Summary of Insights for Graph Data Model

#### Unique Identifiers
- **Battle Number**: Serves as a unique identifier for each battle, ranging from 1 to 38.
- **Family**: Each family can be treated as a unique identifier for nodes representing families.
- **Commander**: Unique identifiers for commanders involved in battles.

#### Significant Properties
- **Army Size**: Represents the size of the army involved in each battle, crucial for analyzing changes over time.
- **Outcome**: Indicates whether the battle was won or lost, important for assessing family effectiveness.
- **Year**: The year in which the battle occurred, essential for tracking changes over time.
- **Location**: The specific location of the battle, providing geographical context.
- **Region**: The broader region where the battle took place, useful for regional analysis.
- **Attacking**: A boolean indicating whether the army was attacking, relevant for understanding aggressive strategies.

#### Possible Node Labels
- **Family**: Represents the different families involved in battles.
- **Battle**: Represents each battle, identified by battle number.
- **Commander**: Represents the commanders leading the armies.
- **Year**: Represents the years in which battles occurred.

#### Possible Relationships
- **ATTACKED**: Connects a Family node to a Battle node, indicating which family attacked in that battle.
- **PARTICIPATED_IN**: Connects a Family node to a Battle node, indicating which families participated in the battle.
- **LED_BY**: Connects a Battle node to a Commander node, indicating which commander led the army in that battle.
- **OCCURRED_IN**: Connects a Battle node to a Year node, indicating when the battle took place.

#### Use Case Insights
1. **Families Changing Alliances**: By analyzing the relationships between Family nodes and Battle nodes, we can track which families frequently switch between attacking and defending roles, as well as their common opponents over time.
2. **Army Size Changes Over Time**: By correlating the Year node with the Army Size property in the Battle node, we can analyze trends in army sizes across different battles and families.
3. **Most Frequent Attackers**: By examining the ATTACKED relationship between Family nodes and Battle nodes, we can identify which families are more aggressive in their strategies and how often they attack.
